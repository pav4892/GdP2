route       | YES
vertical    | YES
ballistic   | YES
ufo         | YES
ufo_thread  | YES
ui_stuff    | YES


Understand why and when it crashes
understand constructor
understand ufo.cpp->waypoint
Understand total flow and order of call


Notes: the delete uthread line is commented out because the runner function in the ufo_thread.h class has flyToDest running and just joining the thread or freeing the memory will cause a hault in the program and not properly
exit so I just leak some memory for dev purposes
